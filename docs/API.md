# API Documentation

Riffado API reference for all endpoints.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Authentication

Browser endpoints require a valid session cookie set by Better Auth.

Automation endpoints under `/api/v1/` also accept API keys:

```http
Authorization: Bearer op_...
```

Keys are created from Settings -> API Keys. The raw key is shown once,
stored as an HMAC-SHA256 hash, and can be revoked at any time. Hashing uses
`API_TOKEN_HASH_SECRET` when set, otherwise `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`; the dedicated
secret is optional and lets operators rotate auth/session secrets independently
from API key hashes. `API_TOKEN_HASH_SECRET` must be at least as strong as
`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.

## Endpoints

### Plaud Integration

#### POST `/plaud/auth/send-code`

Send a one-time verification code to the user's Plaud email. Handles regional redirects automatically — if the account lives on a different regional server, the correct `apiBase` is returned.

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "otpToken": "eyJhbGc...",

}
```

#### POST `/plaud/auth/verify`

Verify the OTP code, obtain a long-lived access token from Plaud, and store the encrypted connection.

**Body:**
```json
{
  "code": "123456",
  "otpToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "apiBase": "https://api-euc1.plaud.ai",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{

#### DELETE `/plaud/connection`

Disconnect the current Plaud account. Deletes the stored connection and device records; synced recordings are preserved in Riffado storage.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

#### POST `/plaud/sync`

Manually trigger sync of recordings from Plaud device.

**Response:**
```json

**Response:**
```json
{
  "recordings": [
    {

### Settings

#### GET `/settings/api-keys`

List API keys for the signed-in user. Requires a session cookie; API keys cannot
manage API keys.

may be added without invalidating existing read keys.

### Automation API v1

All v1 endpoints accept either a browser session cookie or
`Authorization: Bearer op_...`.

#### GET `/v1/recordings`

List recordings with cursor pagination and incremental filters.

**Query Parameters:**
- `cursor`: base64url cursor from `next_cursor`
- `limit`: 1-100, default 50
- `created_since`: ISO timestamp
- `updated_since`: ISO timestamp; includes recording metadata, transcript,
  summary, and generated-title changes
- `has_transcription`: `true` or `false`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "abc123",
      "title": "Meeting Notes",
      "created_at": "2026-05-06T12:00:00.000Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-05-06T12:05:00.000Z",
      "recorded_at": "2026-05-06T11:30:00.000Z",
      "duration_ms": 3600000,
      "filesize_bytes": 15728640,
      "device": {
        "serial_number": "888317426694681884",
        "name": "Plaud Note",
        "model": "Note"
      },
      "has_transcription": true,
      "has_summary": false,
      "links": {
        "self": "/api/v1/recordings/abc123",
        "transcript": "/api/v1/recordings/abc123/transcript",
        "audio": "/api/v1/recordings/abc123/audio"
      }
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": null,
  "has_more": false
}
```

`updated_at` is the recording resource timestamp for v1 clients. It changes
when the recording metadata changes and when transcript, summary, or generated
title state changes.

#### GET `/v1/recordings/[id]`

Return the stable recording shape plus inline `transcript` and `summary`
objects when present.

#### GET `/v1/recordings/[id]/transcript`

Return transcript text and provider metadata, or `404` when the recording has
not been transcribed.

#### GET `/v1/recordings/[id]/audio`

Return a `302` redirect to a presigned S3 URL for S3 storage, or stream local
audio with byte-range support for local storage.

---

### Export & Backup

#### GET `/export`

Export recordings in various formats.

**Query Parameters:**
- `format`: json | txt | srt | vtt

**Response:**
- File download

#### POST `/backup`

Create backup of all user data.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "backupUrl": "/backups/user_20250122_120000.zip"
}
```

- `STORAGE_ERROR`: Storage operation failed
- `EMAIL_SEND_FAILED`: Email notification failed
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Server error

---

## Rate Limiting

Automation endpoints under `/api/v1/*` are rate limited with shared server-side
fixed windows:

- 1,200 requests per minute per client IP.
- 600 requests per minute per authenticated identity (`op_...` key, or user
  session for browser-authenticated calls).

Rate-limited requests return `429` with `Retry-After`,
`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset`
headers.

Forwarding headers such as `X-Forwarded-For` are ignored unless
`RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`; only enable it behind a trusted reverse
proxy that strips or overwrites client-supplied forwarding headers.

When `RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=false` or unset, Riffado cannot derive a
trusted client IP from the request. The unauthenticated IP limiter therefore
uses one shared `"unknown"` bucket of 1,200 requests per minute for the whole
instance. Authenticated identity limits still apply per API key/session at 600
requests per minute.

## Webhooks

Webhooks are configured from Settings -> Webhooks. Target validation is
controlled by `WEBHOOKS_REQUIRE_PUBLIC_TARGETS ?? IS_HOSTED`.

When strict public targets are required, endpoint URLs must use HTTPS, must not
include credentials, must use public hostnames/IPs, and are delivered with DNS
pinning to the resolved public addresses. When strict public targets are not
required, self-host instances may use HTTP, private IPs, loopback addresses,
`.local` names, and Docker service hostnames such as
`http://n8n:5678/webhook`.

Supported events:
- `recording.synced`
- `recording.updated`
- `recording.deleted`
- `transcription.completed`
- `transcription.failed`

Riffado signs each request with HMAC-SHA256:

```http
X-Riffado-Event: transcription.completed
X-Riffado-Delivery: <delivery-id>
X-Riffado-Timestamp: 1778078610
X-Riffado-Signature: t=1778078610,v1=<hex hmac>
```

The signature input is:

```
<unix_timestamp>.<raw_json_body>
```

Verify with the endpoint secret returned on creation. Reject old timestamps
(five minutes is a reasonable default) and compare signatures in constant time.

Delivery uses an in-process worker started by Next.js `instrumentation.ts`.
This matches the Docker deployment model. Stateless serverless deployments need
an external process or cron to run deliveries reliably.

Delivery history stores only minimal event metadata. Recording, transcript, and
summary data are hydrated at delivery time. Retries and manual redelivery also
hydrate data at retry/redelivery time, not at original event time. Consumers
should order events by `delivered_at` and treat `data` as the latest observed
state at delivery time.

Webhook recording links are absolute API URLs built from `APP_URL`. Normal v1
API responses keep their documented relative links.

Webhook transcript payloads include a bounded preview instead of the full text:

```json
{
  "transcript": {
    "preview": "first 500 characters...",
    "truncated": true,
    "length": 24837,
    "language": "en",
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "whisper-1",
    "created_at": "2026-05-06T12:05:00.000Z"
  },
  "links": {
    "transcript": "https://riffado.example/api/v1/recordings/abc123/transcript"
  }
}
```

`recording.deleted` is the exception to normal latest-state hydration because
normal v1 recording reads exclude tombstoned rows. Deleted recording payloads
use tombstoned metadata that is still available, include `deleted_at`, set
`transcript` and `summary` to `null`, and keep absolute resource/API URLs for
identity and follow-up handling.

Retries use exponential backoff: 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour,
then 6 hours. After six failed attempts, the delivery is marked `dead`.

## SDK / Client Libraries

Currently, no official SDK is available. The API is RESTful and can be consumed by any HTTP client.

Example with JavaScript:

```javascript
// Fetch recordings
const response = await fetch('/api/recordings', {
  credentials: 'include'  // Include session cookie
});
const data = await response.json();
```
