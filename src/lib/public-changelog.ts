/**
 * Hosted-user-facing changelog.
 *
 * Hand-curated at release time by the maintainer, in parallel with the
 * technical `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root. The two sources serve
 * different audiences:
 *
 *   - `CHANGELOG.md`     -- self-host operators + contributors. Carries
 *                           env vars, PR numbers, migration notes, and
 *                           internal refactors. Source of truth for
 *                           "what's running on my box".
 *   - `PUBLIC_CHANGELOG` -- hosted-instance users. Plain language, no
 *                           PR numbers, no env vars, no internal
 *                           refactors. Source of truth for "what
 *                           changed in the app I use".
 *
 * Structure mirrors `CHANGELOG.md`: one entry per release, each release
 * carrying its own dated bundle of items. This matches how releases
 * actually ship -- many user-visible changes land together under one
 * version tag -- and avoids the "May 15 -> May 15 -> May 15" repetition
 * that month-grouping produces when several features release on the
 * same day.
 *
 * Workflow on release:
 *   1. Move the technical entries from `[Unreleased]` to a new
 *      released version section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
 *   2. Prepend a new `PublicChangelogRelease` to `PUBLIC_CHANGELOG`
 *      with the version, date, and one plain-language item per
 *      hosted-user-visible change.
 *   3. Skip changes that are operator-only (admin dashboard internals,
 *      migration scripts, infra-only fixes that a user never knew
 *      were broken).
 *
 * Style guide for items:
 *   - Title: verb-led, plain language, no jargon ("See your recording
 *     as you listen", not "Waveform player with peak caching").
 *   - Body: 1-3 sentences. Name what the user gets, not how it works.
 *   - No PR numbers, no GitHub issue refs, no env var names.
 *   - Vendor names only when meaningful to the user ("Plaud") -- not
 *     for repetition.
 *   - Wrap keyboard shortcuts in backticks: `` `Cmd K` ``, `` `?` ``,
 *     `` `Ctrl Enter` ``. The page renders backticked spans as styled
 *     keyboard-key chips. Group keys pressed together inside one pair
 *     of backticks; use separate pairs for alternative shortcuts
 *     (`` `Cmd K` (or `Ctrl K`) ``).
 *
 * Rendered at `/changelog` (hosted-only). Self-host visitors to that
 * route are redirected to `CHANGELOG.md` on GitHub, which is the
 * accurate source for their installed version.
