/**
 * Public rebrand explainer.
 *
 * Single source of truth for "why the name change" -- linked from the
 * landing announcement bar, the in-app banner, the `/changelog` entry,
 * and (operationally) the `openplaud.com` redirect.
 *
 * Rendered for everyone, including self-host. This is a one-time-event
 * note about an action the project took, not about the state of the
 * hosted service -- a self-host operator visiting `/rebrand` gets the
 * same accurate story as a hosted user.
 *
 * Tone matches `for-professionals.tsx` ("I'll reply personally"): the
 * project speaks with a personal voice from its maintainer, not as a
 * faceless team. Structure leads with rumor-killing ("not a buyout"),
 * then the story (why), then the practical reassurance (what stays).
 * Signed by name to cash the trust check.

                            vendor. Plaud Note is the device family we support
                            today and that isn&apos;t changing &mdash; sync,
                            transcription, and everything else continues to work
                            exactly the way it did yesterday. But the roadmap
                            has always been broader than one recorder, and every
                            conversation about it started with the same
                            question: &quot;is this only for Plaud?&quot; The
                            old name kept boxing us in. Riffado is a name we can
                            grow into without explaining a contradiction.
