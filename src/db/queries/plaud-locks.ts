/**
 * Acquire a per-user advisory lock for the duration of the current
 * transaction. Serialises concurrent Plaud connect / reconnect attempts so
 * the upsert into `plaud_connections` doesn't race with itself and produce
 * orphan rows or stomp a freshly-rotated bearer token.
 *
 * `hashtextextended(text, 0)` is Postgres's 64-bit text hash used by
 * `pg_advisory_xact_lock(bigint)`. We don't need cryptographic
 * collision-resistance here -- a hash collision would only mean two
 * unrelated users serialise on the same lock for a few hundred
 * milliseconds, which is harmless. We do need stability across processes,
 * which is exactly what advisory locks give us (and what an in-memory
 * Map does NOT, under hosted multi-process invariants).
 *
 * The `plaud_connect:` prefix scopes this lock namespace so a future
 * lock on the same userId for a different purpose doesn't deadlock with
 * this one.
