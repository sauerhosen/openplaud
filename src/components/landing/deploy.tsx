/**
 * Self-host section that follows `Pricing`. Argues the self-host tier
 * one more time, in detail, for readers who skipped past the pricing
 * card -- and gives them a real way to act on it (copyable install
 * one-liner + Deploy CTA + source link).
 *
 * Design rules (read before editing):
 *
 * - Surface is `bg-secondary/10 border-y` -- same as `TheMath` above
 *   Pricing. Deliberately NOT the dark `bg-auth-brand` surface that
 *   `FinalCTA` uses; the page would otherwise have two near-identical
 *   dark warm-sepia sections sandwiching `FAQ`, and `FinalCTA` is
 *   meant to be the unique dark closer.
 *
 * - Visual rhyme with `Pricing` is intentional: same eyebrow type
 *   treatment, same `Check` icons on the proof list. The two sections
 *   read as one argument about self-host -- price card on top,
 *   install proof underneath.
 *
 * - No primary button in this section. The Self-host pricing tier
 *   card directly above already has a `Deploy with Docker` button to
 *   `/install`; repeating it here was a redundant CTA at the same
 *   visual weight, ~200px apart. Per the landing CTA ladder, only
 *   Hero / Pricing / FinalCTA carry primary asks. Deploy's job here
 *   is proof, not a second ask -- the only inline link points to
 *   `/install` as a quiet anchor for readers who scrolled past
 *   Pricing.
 *
 * - The terminal shows the REAL documented install path
 *   (`INSTALL_ONELINER` from `src/lib/install-commands.ts`), copyable
 *   via `CopyableCommand`. Do not replace it with a fake
 *   `git clone / cd / docker compose up` script -- that's not the
 *   documented self-host flow. See `/install` page and
 *   `scripts/install.sh` for the canonical contract.
 *
 * - Proof points only claim what the code delivers today: AGPL on
 *   GitHub, no telemetry / no license server, pluggable storage
 *   (local or any S3-compatible bucket), pluggable AI (including
 *   browser Whisper and Ollama). No invented quotas, no compliance
 *   claims we don't own. Mirrors the Self-host tier features in
 *   `pricing.tsx` 1:1 so the two surfaces stay consistent.
 *
 * - `id="deploy"` is referenced by `/install` "← Back to landing"
 *   (`/#deploy`). Keep the id.
